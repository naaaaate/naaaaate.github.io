        <h2>Conflict</h2>
        <h3>Break it down</h3>
        <h4>4/13/15</h4>
          <p>
          This week, we are writing about conflicts and breaking them down to the root of what the problem really is. A lot of times its really easy to say you feel angry but what's causing that feeling may be a deeper issue. The only way to understand that is to talk it out and break it down to its most basic form. Lets take a look at an example of conflict.
          <br>
          I think the last time I had a real conflict was with a family member over something as dumb as being on time to a basketball game. I told this family member I was going to be at their place around 7pm to pick them up for the game. I was running a little late because I was tired from all the other errands I had run that day. So when I texted this person that I was running a little late things escalated and we got into a huge argument. They wanted to be on time because they were looking forward to really going to this event. I didn't think it was a big deal to be on time because the seats were terrible, and I had been to so many games already knowing what to expect. I think the source of the conflict was that I didnt consider the other person's feelings, excitement, or how important this event was to them. On the other side I felt disrespected because of how tired I was from all the things I had to that day, and on top of that, they weren't even my tickets. They invited me to the game and I felt like I was being generous offering to drive even though I really didnt want to go.
          <br>
          The basic emotion I felt was anger and disrespect. I felt like the other person did not respect the fact that even though I didnt want to go to the game, or drive, and was tired from all the errands I had to run earlier that day, I still went out of the way to accomodate them, even if I was a late.
          <br>
          The actions I took to resolve the conflict was to stop texting, pull over to a gas station, and call the person on the phone. I heard their side of the story and they heard mine. I think if I could go back and change anything, I would have been more open and honest about how I felt and not gone to the event. The thing I learned most about this was to be more honest about my feelings even if its hard for the other person, or not what the other person wants to hear.
