        <h2>Fireside Chat w Shereef Blog</h2>
        <h3>Having a Kitchen Mentality</h3>
        <h4>3/1/15</h4>
          <p>
            After watching the Fireside chat with Shareef video, I feel like that was exactly what I needed to hear before starting this journey at DevBootCamp.First of all, the kitchen mentality he talked about was very inspiring and a good reminder to not sit back and sort of just take what is handed to me, but rather to come in with a mindset to go above and beyond, with hunger for more and also to know that I’m not in this alone. I feel like the idea of working together and helping each other out and staying humble through this process appeals a lot to me because that is much the same way I look at life.  Some of the fears he discussed such as the fear of not knowing as much as the next person in my cohort and not knowing the right answer all the time or how to solve an issue kind of put my mind at ease.  We all have to start somewhere in our dev journey, nobody knows it all, and we all make mistakes. These are just great reminders and really inspiration to keep going for more and to work as hard as I possibly can at DevBootCamp.  With all of the Empathy training, Tutoring sessions, pairing sessions, and teacher’s assistance that are available to us, I feel like this is a learning environment that is just right for me. I can’t wait to get started at DevBootCamp and at the end of the day, I’m just excited for the opportunity to form relationships with amazing people who share the same passion for learning as I do.
