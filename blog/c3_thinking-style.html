        <h2>Thinking Style</h2>
        <h3>I think, therefore, I am.</h3>
        <h4>3/15/15</h4>
          <p>
            This week I was asked to write a blog on my thoughts about DBC: my struggles so far, my thinking style, and how I can maybe use some of that info to my advantage in this program.
            <br>
            After taking the personal thinking style quiz, (which you can find here: <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Thinking Style Quiz </a>), the results show that my style is a: "Concrete Sequential" (CS). A few characteristics of CS's are: they are known to like order, logical sequence, predictability, facts, and following directions, just to name a few. These characteristics describe me to the T! It's also said that CS's learn best when in a structured environment and can rely on others to complete a task. I feel I can use my understanding of my thinking style to my advantage because DBC provides such a structured environment to learn from and I feel that bc people in my cohort are very similar in their transition to a new career like myself, I can therefore rely on others to complete some of the same tasks that I am aiming for.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Now, with that being said, there is always two sides to a coin. I must say that even thought DBC is structured very well, in these first 3 weeks there have been times that I have struggled to learn some of the material.I think the biggest reason for that is because of the limited time I have with working 40+ hrs a week and staying up late trying to finish challenges on time. At times I feel a little rushed at times when it comes to learning the material, such as the web design and ruby code, bc althought the DBC program is structured well, the sites I navigate to on google to learn the actual material for the challenges being presented are not always ordered or in a logical sequence. Therefore being a CS is hard at times, bc I know that just about every day I will be faced with an unpredicatable situation and if you add that on top of the little time I already have to work with, it makes things just that much tougher. But no excuses..
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            One of the things I'm constantly reminded of at DBC and even from some of my peers is that I need to stay focused on a growth mindset. A growth mindset basically sees failure as an opportunity to grow and get better at that obstacle that has stopped you in your place. A fixed mindset on the other hand says because you have failed, you are not cut out for this career path. ie: Because you didnt know how to complete that challenge like the others in your group did, your not going to make it as a developer. And that ideaology could not be further from the truth. If anything, it pushes me and motivates me to get better and focus on areas that I am weak at in coding. I think the key to getting better is continued practice and reaching out for help when I need it the most. A lot of times I've found that just by simply picking the brains of my fellow co-horts has helped me learn concepts that they can explain to me in a more relevant way than a book or someone typing a random blog ever could. I think taking this plan of action is what will make me a more  well rounded person, which will hopefully translate into learning more efficiently in the future.
            <br>
            Thanks,
            <br>
