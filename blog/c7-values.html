        <h3>Overcoming StereoType Threats</h3>
        <h4>4/12/15</h4>
          <p>

          Last week, we were asked to define some of the stereotype threats that we faced or still face due to the social groups we belong to. I was able to identify some of the social groups I belonged to that I felt put me in a position to experience stereotype threat in some way. According to research, one of the ways to fight sterotype threat is through self affirmation of the the values that are important to you.
          So, this week, I wanted to point some of those values out and discuss how affirming those values in my life will help me to combat a situation where stereotype threat may occur.
          <br>
          First of all, I think one of the things I value most is hard work. Doing quality work takes time, and I feel like that is one thing of the things I value most in my work and also admire in others when they exemplify quality work. Therefore, I believe that re-affirming this value in situations where negative stereotypes about being from a state where academics are poor and where the media portrays my geographic location to be non-progessive, will help encourage me to keep working hard and not let the negative feelings affect me or my work.
          <br>
          Also, I mentioned last week how belonging to a minority race has had its own set of negative stereotypes that I've felt throughout the years and at times still continue to feel. I feel that because in the state of Louisiana, there is not a big population of Asian Americans, a lot of times I am the odd man out, or I get overlooked or treated differently bc of preconceived ideas about Asians that are portrayed in and influenced by the media. To combat this negative stereotype, another value that I have is honesty and authenticity in the sense of staying true to yourself and who you are no matter how others try to box you in or how the media portrays you or your race. After what I've been through and experienced stereotypically speaking, I am comfortable with being a little different and I simply need to continue to remind myself that at the end of the day, if I'm not being authentic and I keep trying to fit into someone else's box I'll never be satisfied and will always be searching for who I really am. Being comfortable with my race and where I'm from and being different is what makes me who I am and reaffirming this in a negative stereotypical situation will help me to maintain composure and continue to produce quality work in the face of adversity.
          <br>
          In saying all this, I hope to shed some more light into who I am and the negative stereotypes that I face. But I also say these things to highlight the values in my life that will help reaffirm who I am and encourage me to work hard and fulfill my dream of becoming a developer.
