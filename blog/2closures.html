          <h1>Closures in JavaScript</h1>
            <p class="post-type">Jul 14th 2015</p>

            <p>What better way to kick this thing off by starting with the simple concept of "Closures"! </p>

            <p><strong>(jk.. maybe not so simple..Calm Down.)</strong></p>

            <p>
              At Dev Bootcamp, you recieve a somewhat high level view of many topics. One being "Closures" within JavaScript. So I wanted to explore this concept a little more. I am currently going thru the "Front End Masters" course with a few cohort mates from Dev Bootcamp so a lot of my tech blog topics will be drawn from there.. Anyways, lets dive deep...
            </p>
            <p>
            While closures are a tricky subject to master, please note that it is not impossible by any means. I'll admit, when a classmate first tried explaining this concept to me, I wanted to run away and never look at closures again.. So  if you are feeling anywhere remotely close to this when talking about closures, don't give up! It will eventually come to you!
            </p>
            <p>
            Let me start by giving the textbook definition of a closure and we'll go from there...
            </p>

            <p>
            Here is the definition of a closure on Mozilla's Developer network:
            </p>
            <p>"Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. In other words, the function defined in the closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created."</p>

            <p>Simple enough right???  </p>

            <p>Yeah, if only it were that simple.. lets try to make some sense of this.</p>

            <p>Hopefully you are familiar with functions in javascript. (if not, please familiarize yourself with functions, as they are used for just about everything in JavaScript!) An easy way to think of a closure is a function that is inside of another function. That's it! So anytime you see another function inside of a function, just know that the inner function is just a word that some guy made up years ago and decided to call it a "closure". No Big Deal. </p>

            <p>What makes a "Closure" so special (and maybe in some ways confusing) is that the inner function or "closure" has access to the outer function's variables. Crazy right?  So at a very high level without going into the in's and outs of why thats even possible, just know that a closure is a function inside of another function that has access to its parent function's variables.  Lets take a look at an example.
            </p>
            <p>
              say we have defined a function.. lets call it banana...
            </p>
            <code>

              var banana = function(x){ <br>
                var count = x;<br>

                return bananaSplit = function(){<br>
                  console.log("you have", count, "bananas");<br>
                }<br>
              }<br>

              <strong>var nate = banana(23); </strong><br>
            </code>
              <p>//on the right hand side of the equal sign, banana function will be invoked (or ran) and the number 23 will be passed as an argument to the function.  Whatever the function banana returns will be returned to the right hand side of the equal sign. in this case its the: bananaSplit function.</p>

            <code>
              <strong>nate();</strong><br>
            </code>
            <p>
            //now we invoke the function nate which is pointing to the function bananaSplit().

          </p>
              <p>The Main takeaways to note are that: <br>
                1. the inner function is the closure.  <br>
                2.  bananaSplit has access to the variable called: "count" in the parent function.  <br>
                3. I'm calling the banana function and setting it equal to var nate. the way it works is: banana(23) will invoke the banana function and pass in 23 to the count variable. then it will return the bananaSplit function.. so you can think of it now as: var nate = bananaSplit function. <br>
                4. Now when I call nate() it will run or invoke the bananaSplit function which console logs how many bananas we have. and remember bananaSplit still has access to all the variables inside of the banana parent function.</p>
            <p>Simple enough right???  </p>
            <p>Again, I know closures are not a simple concept that most people can grasp at first glance, but with enough practice you will get it soon enough!</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or comments please hit me up on twitter (@n8leedbc)! thanks! </p>
