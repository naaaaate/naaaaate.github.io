        <h2>Rails</h2>
        <h3>A brief overview of Ruby on Rails</h3>
        <h4>4/12/15</h4>
          <p>
            This week we were asked to pick a topic and write a blog explaining the subject a little bit more. I chose to give a brief overview on Rails because frankly, I had no idea what is is. So without further ado, lets discuss what Rails really is.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            A lot of times you will hear the phrase: "Ruby on Rails", and it is easy to associate Rails as being Ruby, but you must note that Rails and Ruby are 2 separate things. Rails is the framework used for building web applications. Rails is NOT a programming language. However, the programming language that Rails uses is Ruby.
            <br>
            After a little research, one of the common themes about Rails is that it was created with "programmer productivity" in mind. This means that rails has a strict set of naming conventions (ie: folders and classes) so that it is simple, without losing its flexibility. When people say Rails has a standard framework and language they are really referring to the fact that other languages such as PHP, have a number of different frameworks which makes developing or updating a program difficult because you must know that particular framework. On the other hand, Rails has a standard or set framework, so that if you needed updates or a new program, any Rails developer could jump on the project and begin coding without much downtime. Rails is a very strong development framework that can handle social media sites and e-commerce, and it was interesting to note that sites such as Twitter and groupon among others were built on Rails.
            <br>
            Another benefit of using Rails is tha tit runs independent of a webserver and actually has its own. So you can run Rails and test right on your own machine. Rails works with multiple types of databses. It comes with sqlite3 database but is very capable of working with other databases such as mysql.
            <br>
            One of the common themes I've read while researching Rails was that it is based on an "MVC" (Model, View, Controller Design). This is a very effective design concept that many developers like to use because it separates what users see from the backend, logic, queries, tests etc.. that go in the actual program.
          </p>
          <br>
          That about sums up my brief overview of what Rails is, and what some of the benefits of using Rails are. I know there is a lot more to Rails and I did not touch on a lot of the details, but the basic idea is that it is an amazing framework for development.
          <p>

            Thanks for reading!
            <br>
