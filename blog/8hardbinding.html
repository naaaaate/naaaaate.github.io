            <h1>Hard Binding in JavaScript (for Beginners)</h1>
            <p class="post-type">Jul 26th 2015</p>

            <p>
              I wanted to quickly touch on the subject of "Hard Binding". We saw examples of hard binding in the previous blog on the 'this' keyword where we talked about the explicit binding rule that uses the keywords .call and .apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hard binding is a way to make the 'this' keyword predicatable. Now, it is important to be able to make 'this' predicatable because when you are passing around functions to other methods, the 'this' keyword gets somewhat lost in translation. So in order to keep track of what object the 'this' keyword refers to, we need to know where the call site is at all times! Note: Whenever you are calling a function if it calls another function and that function hard binds an object, then that becomes the call site. Because that inner function call is the new call site, it will override any object that any of its parent functions hard bind. Important: So you could say that the deepest level hard bind object, is the 'this' keyword. CONFUSED? Great! lets look at an example to clear all this up.
              <pre><code>
              function foo(){
                console.log(this.bar)
              }
              var obj = {bar: “bar”}
              var obj2 = {bar: “bar2”}

              var orig = foo;

              foo = function(){ orig.call(obj); };
              -------------------------------------
              foo(); //“bar”
              foo.call(obj2); // ???
            </pre></code>
            In our example here, when we call foo() below the dotted line, what is going on? <br>
            Well, 1. Notice how the function foo at the top gets assigned to 'var orig' in the middle of the code. So now 'var orig' points to function foo at the top. Then on the next line below var orig, where it says: <br>
            foo = function(){ orig.call(obj); }; <br>
            Make a note that in the function block, orig which points to function foo at the top is being called, however it is binding the  global OBJECT: 'obj' to it in the parentheses. Therefore, the outcome when function foo is called and console logs (this.bar), the 'this' keyword is pointing to var obj and obj.bar evaluates to: "bar".<br>
            <br>
            But what happens on the last line below the dotted line that says: <br>
            foo.call(obj2);<br>
            Well, we are trying to override that obj hard binding, by calling obj2. But it doesn't work. This will still print out "bar"! WHY? <br>
            Because even though foo.call(obj2) explicitly binds obj2 as the 'this' keyword, the inner function call where it says: <br>
            orig.call(obj); }; <br>
            Will OVERRIDE the outer foo.call(obj2) explicit bind.  So now, there is a new "CALL SITE"! and this new "call site" is at: orig.call(obj)! Therefore, the outer hard bounded object: "obj2" is ignored and the inner hard bounded object: "obj" is set as the 'this' keyword object! This is what is meant by "Hard Binding!"
