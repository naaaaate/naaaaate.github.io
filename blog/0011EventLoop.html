              WOW! I cant believe its been a whole year since i started this blog! It's been a crazy journey so far and although I still have not landed a fulltime job as a developer, I'm still pushing myself to learn and code on the side.  Anyways, today I read a blog post by a lady who works as a developer in Seattle who explained her journey to becoming a developer. She started out in a foreign country, passed a few exams and got accepted into a University in her home country. She admits that it was a rough time for her because she wasn't by any means the smartest in the class and was having a tough time keeping up in class, and simply felt like she wasn't cut out for coding and that her brain wasn't meant for this. She goes on to talk about how it was not that she wasn't cut out for coding or didnt have the brain for it, as others in her class were picking it up fine, it was more so the fact that her classmates had been exposed to all of this stuff at a younger age. She realized she had the same potential to be an amazing developer just like anyone else! From this mindset shift, she began to change her study/work habits and get assignments started earlier, and eventually her GPA rose and she started to excel. One important thing that she said that stood out the most to me was: "Things don't always get easier... it’s you who becomes better at working through hardships. I made a choice to not lose faith in myself."
            </p>
            <p>
              Reading that today really inspired me to get back on the wagon and start coding again.  Yeah, it gets extremely discouraging when you're not finding work in the field you quit everything for, but giving up will never accomplish anything either. So here we are today, jumping back into the swing of things..
            </p>
            <p>
              I started this blog talking about Javascript so I wanted to continue down that path. I'm currently on Treehouse's website going back through the fundamentals of Javascript basically because I need to.. It's true, you either use it or lose it. But things are slowly starting to come back to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, I wanted to blog today about something I found interesting about Javascript: "The Event Loop".  It is important to understand what the Event Loop is, because in doing so, you will better understand how Javascript works and how to write better efficient code.
              The Event Loop in a nutshell is a mediator that controls what gets thrown onto the stack from the task queue. If that didn't any sense, I will put it in words a beginner can understand in a few minutes.
              But before doing so, please be aware of a few things. The stack is part of Javascript where, when a function runs, that process gets thrown onto the stack until it completes. So think of the stack as a place where your code actually runs and performs the functions, console logs, outputs, etc.. The task queue is where callback functions that have to process get thrown into bc they are taking a while to process that information. For example, if you did an AJAX call to a remote server to bring back the information of that website to your page, its going to take some time. Because Javascript runs asynchronously, it goes to the next task without waiting for the callback / AJAX call to complete and will run the very next task. But what happens to the CallBack when it get the AJAX information from remote webserver. Well, when the AJAX call comes back, it will throw the information into the task queue.Now remember, in order for any code that you develop to actually run, it has to get thrown onto the stack, so for your AJAX call in this example to get thrown onto the stack, the stack must be completely clear. I'll say it again, the stack has to be clear or finished running all of its functions in order to run anything that comes from the task queue.  Now, I know that can all still be confusing, but lets look at an analogy that I thought of.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want you to think of the Event Loop as a chef in a kitchen at a restaurant. The chef cooks the food and puts it on the plate of the customers at the restaurant. Now, think of the food that the chef makes as the callback functions that take a while to process and return from remote webservers. The chef won't put the food that he has cooked on the customers plate, unless there is a clean plate for the chef to place the food on. This is similar to the Event Loop not putting the callback function that needs to run on the stack, until the stack is cleared and finished running all of its processes. Now once there is a clean plate available, the chef can put the food on that clean plate and a server can come pick it up and deliver it to the customer. Same analogy, the Event Loop can take what is in the task queue, and throw in on the stack so that the code can actually run, but again only if the stack is clear.

      <p>I know that was a long one, but hopefully that helps clear up prototypes in JavaScript. If you have any questions or comments about this blog, please contact me on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/n8leeDBC">@n8leedbc</a>)! thanks! </p>
