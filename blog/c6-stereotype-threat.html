          This week we were asked to write about stereotype threats and if we've been impacted by it. First, lets define what exactly stereotype threats are. According to Claude M. Steele and his lifetime research, StereoType threat can be defined as being in a situation where you feel you are at the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about the social group you belong to. Now, what do these social groups consist of? Steele defined group membership in categories such as age, gender, religion and ethnicity. Another way to say it is: Stereotype Threat is being in a certain moment where a negative stereotype about one of your identities is relevant and now you could be reduced to that and judged in terms of that.
          <br>
          One interesting point, that Steele makes in his article is that this happens to everybody! There's not one group of people that can't relate when it comes to stereotype threats. So, I think the first thing for me to realize is that it is relevant to me in some way shape or form. When I look at the social groups that I belong to, I think the times that I've experienced stereotype threat the most have been due to where I'm from, my race, my age and my gender.  For example, sometimes I feel as though the fact that I'm from Southern Louisiana gets looked down upon bc of poor academics and what is portrayed by the media. It's a terrible feeling when someone makes some kind of joke about how Louisiana is slow or dumb compared to other states. So when I'm not understanding a concept in programming or pairing with someone who makes these kinds of references, it does feel like I'm being judged and makes me feel somewhat reduced to that.
          <br>
          Also, as an Asian-American, there's always been this underlying stereotype that I've felt, as if I was expected to perform at an extremely high level academically or on the job simply because of my race.Now this may not be seen as a negative stereotype but I've felt at times overwhelemed if I could not live up to the "standard" I was automatically expected to be. This in turn could have a negative affect on achievement when in reality that kind of pressure should never be there to begin with.
          <br>
          I understand that change is not easy to come by, and on the flip side there's a reason stereotypes become stereotypes, but maybe one solution to all this is to simply do what we're doing right now, and that is to continually bring more awareness to this issue. I think poeple judge others and think certain ways about other races and genders because they are not aware of how that other group feels negative stereotypes are being thrown at them. Communication is key and more importantly open communication is what I feel can bring the most change.
