        <h2>Asking Good Questions</h2>
        <h3>It's an art..</h3>
        <h4>4/26/15</h4>
          <p>
          This week, I'm writing on the topic of "How to ask good questions." There have been times where I've posted in a message board or google plus community and did not recieve an answer, and I think the main cause of this was probably due to the fact that the question was not asked the best way, even though I felt it was as clear as day. So, in order to avoid this in the future, I wanted to look at a few ways on how we could all provide more clarity to our questions.

          After researching a few articles online, one of the common themes is that "if the title isn't interesting, the reader will not read it." This is so true as even in my own experience when looking at questions on message boards and forums. If I do not understand the question or if its not 100% clear, I will usually keep scrolling and avoid it. Remember, the title is the first thing that readers see, so be sure to make a good first impression.

          Generally speaking, one pet peve of mine is when people are long winded, beat around the bush, and never get to the point. So in my opinion, another way to ask good questions is to simply use common sense. People value their time and do not want to be reading super long descriptions of the problem you are asking (at least, I know I don't). So it might be a good idea to be as descriptive as you can but at the same time, try to make sure the details actually pertain to the problem at hand and aren't going off on a tanget.

            Another good point that was made in the articles I researched was to imagine yourself trying to answer the question. If you look at the question you just posted and were trying to answer it, would you need any additional information? or how about an example? or some extra information you've already tried so that you are not chasing rabbit holes that lead to nowhere. Always put yourself in the readers position and try to formulate questions from that perspective if you want to be effective. Furthermore, it may be a good idea to reference some of the other questions that are similar to your question and to explicitly state how your results differed from that situation. A lot of times we have similar questions, but there are many variations of results that do not line up with the results you got. Providing this information can be very beneficial to anyone answering the question as it helps to narrow down the problem.

            Finally, I think one point I think is often overlooked when asking good questions is making a good impression. One article online mentioned how giving yourself a meaningful username is a good idea as people will take you seriously and it shows a level of commitment on your part to the forum members. Another great point is to use correct grammar and spelling for obvious reasons; remember: Proofreading is always a great idea before you actually post the question. Although posting greetings and sign-off messages like "Hey everybody" and "hope to hear from you soon" are forms of being polite, try to do away with these as it may come across as a distraction to tech readers who are trying to answer your question.
          </p>

            Although there are many other great tips for asking good questions, I just wanted to highlight a few of them that I felt were important or may be often overlooked. Like I mentioned before, a lot of it is common sense and respecting other's time and intelligence. Remember to always put yourself in the reader's position and to make sure the question you are asking, is actually a question.
