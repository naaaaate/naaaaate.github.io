            <h1>Scope in JavaScript (for Beginners)</h1>
            <p class="post-type">Jul 22nd 2015</p>

            <p>After watching a few hours of the Front End Masters Advanced Javascript series, I wanted to write a blog on some more of the basics of Javascript.  Today I want to discuss scope, what it is, and why its so important.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I first heard about scope, a lot of questions came to mind, such as: What is it? When should I use it? How do I use it? etc..
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me start by sharing my definition of scope within Javascript.  Scope to me refers to what is in your "personal space". Think of your desk at work or your bedroom at home. It's your personal space, and everything in that space belongs to you (or should belong to you..). The same can be said of scope within Javascript.  Think of Scope simply as the "personal space" where things like variables and other objects and methods more than likely belong to a function. I say "more than likely" because sometimes variables and functions can belong to the "GLOBAL" scope (the part of your program that is accessible to everything... google global scope if you are still confused). </p>
              <p>As a side note: its important to note that functions are very important because they define their own scope. So anytime you see a function in Javascript just know that it has its own personal space within your program. Kind of simliar to how another sibling means they have their own personal space in the house. Also note that functions are first class citizens which means: they "support all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as a parameter, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable." (Thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen">Wikipedia!!!</a>). If that doesn't make any sense just know that functions can be passed into other functions, can be returned from other functions(read my <a href="2closures.html">blog on closures</a>), and can be assigned to a variable.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realize I just rabbit-holed on functions but please note how essential it is to understanding functions and how they work. Anyways, back to scope.. As I said earlier, scope is just a functions "personal space", or the global program's "personal space".
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason why its so important to understand scope is because as your programs grow, you want to know what variables are allowed to be called in a function or where you are allowed to call certain functions within the program. It all has to do with scope. Think of our room example: If there's an item that belongs to your sibling and it is in their room, then you are not allowed to use it because its not within your personal space. That's how scope works!
            </p>
            <p>
              Ok, now that you're understanding scope a little better, lets look at some simple code examples..
            </p>

        <pre><code>
          var foo = “bar”;  //this is in the global scope.

          function bar() {
            var foo = “magic”; //this is in the function bar's scope.
          }

          function baz(foo) {
            foo = “banana”; //this is in the function baz's scope.
            bam = “panda”; //this is in the global scope!!! ???
          }

        </pre></code>

        <p>
          As you can see in the code above, we have the first var foo in the global scope.  The second var foo is in teh function bar's scope, because remember functions define their own scope! Functions are special in Javascript. The third variable foo is defined in the parameter declaration where it says: "  function baz(foo) {  ".  Please note that just because you dont see a keyword: var, does not mean a variable foo is not being defined, it is implicitly being defined here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in the last line that says: bam = “panda”; the variable panda is actually being declared in the global scope at what's called "runtime"... What is this runtime you ask? and why is bam being declared in global scope and not the scope its already in (which in this case is function baz's scope)? I will answer these intriguing questions in my next blog post...
        </p>

          <p>For now, that is a basic overview of how scope in JavaScript works. If you have any questions or comments about this blog, please hit me up on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/n8leeDBC">@n8leedbc</a>)! thanks! </p>
