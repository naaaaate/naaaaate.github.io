        <h3>A tutorial on how to use Classes.</h3>
        <h4>3/28/15</h4>
          <p>
            This week we learned a lot about classes in Ruby. So today, my goal is to show some examples of what a class is and why we use it. The topic of classes is one that can go into a lot of depth so my main goal is to highlight the main points and not be too overwhelming.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            If you are not familiar with programming and classes, it is good to note from the start that classes are a great way to group objects or things together. For example if you had a dogs and cats you might want to group them into an animal class, or if you had boys and girls you want to organize you might want to group them into a person class. Classes are a great way to get organized.
            <br>
            Now Lets begin by creating a sample class. We do this by typing in the keyword class and then naming it appropriately by what we want to group the rest of its objects.
            <pre>
              class Dog

              end
            </pre>
            As you can see I have created a simple Dog class that will hold attributes and actions (more technically known as: "Methods" in Ruby) for different types of dogs. So for example: Pugs, Bulldogs, Labs, and German Shepherds are all different types of dogs, but at the same time are still dogs. So they belong to the Dog class. Also note, that dogs share same characteristics and actions, ie: they all have a name, age, gender, and can bark, roll over, sit, fetch, chew, etc.. so we can program these "attributes" and actions" into our class method like so..
            <pre>
              class Dog

                def initialize(name, age, gender)
                  @name = name
                  @age = age
                  @gender = gender
                end
              end
            </pre>
            First, lets add some characteristics about all dogs..
            <br>
            They all have a name, age and gender at the very least. So here I am doing 2 things:
              <ol>
                <li>I am storing these characteristics in what is known as an "instance variable". This means it has an "@" symbol and can be used in other methods (or actions) that I define in this class.
                <li> I am storing these "instance variables" in a method called "initialize." Initialize is a great method that basically means everytime you create a new Dog object, it will automatically setup these 3 variables (name, age, and gender) with the values you pass into the new object.
              </ol>
              <br>
              You create a new dog object like this:
              <pre>
                pitbull = Dog.new("Rex", 3, "Male")
              </pre>
              As you can see the object is named: "pitbull", the Class: Dog, the ".new" keyword: means create a new Dog, and the 3 input arguments that will get setup in our class for later use with other methods.
              <br>
              Lets look at another example.. this time we will add a method to our Dog class, then we will create a new dog called: "Snoop" and We will give it 3 characteristics and tell him to bark.
              <br>

              class Dog

                def initialize(name, age, gender)
                  @name = name
                  @age = age
                  @gender = gender
                end

                def bark
                  puts "Bow-Wow-Wow, Yippie-Yo, Yippie-Yay!"
                end
              end

              snoop = Dog.new("SnoopDogg", 40, "Male")
              snoop.bark
              <br>
              As you can see, we created a new method called "bark" with the "def bark" code that prints out "Bow-Wow-Wow, Yippie-Yo, Yippie-Yay!". Also note that after creating the new dog object, to call methods on an object we use the "dot", plus the name of the method! so in this case: snoop.bark will return: "Bow-Wow-Wow, Yippie-Yo, Yippie-Yay!"
              <br>
              To go a little further in depth, you can add as many variables and methods to your class, just make sure they are related to the Dog class and are not characteristics of a Dinasour, Elephant, or a Cat!
              Keep everything organized into related groupings.
              Also, when you create variables, you do not have to use the "@" symbol.The drawback is that if you do not use "@" symbol, then you cannot use that variable in other methods in the class. For example if name was not @name, you could not use it in the bark method.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            That touches on some of the basics of classes, methods and variables.
            I hope this tutorial has helped you to better understand what Classes are, why we use them, how to create objects of classes and how to call methods on those objects.
            <br>
            Thanks,
            <br>
