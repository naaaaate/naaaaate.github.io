        <h2>Challenges facing the IT Industry</h2>
        <h3>Growing pains..</h3>
        <h4>3/22/15</h4>
          <p>
            After doing a lot of research on some of the top issues facing the IT Industry today, I chose to go with one familiar one to many CIO's and directors in IT: how to increase growth within your company.
            <br>
            Many times, it seems IT Managers are tasked with the responsibility of utilizing IT strategies to increase their companies growth, which generally means: make us more money. Now, even though there are no clear cut answers and some of the solutions involved have issues of their own, I'd like to take a look at some of the things hindering growth in a company and also some solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, when talking about some of the issues hindering growth or profitability of a company, I think you have to look at the issue of old technology mindsets and money. What I mean is, a lot of companies are still stuck in an old infrastructure mindset and may not want to pay out the big bucks to implement new technologies that could help drive their business forward simply because it may be too risky. One thing to look at is how business is changing into an online, social media marketed, cloud based, app driven world. A lot of business is now being done on mobile devices and cloud computing is a new and exciting technology that companies are slowly implementing to help their businesses out. For example: Office 365 lets you pay a montly subscription fee to use all microsoft office products as well as cloud storage space to share files. This is much more efficient from an IT perspective as you get updates online and can manage users easily from anywhere you have internet access.
            But in saying all of this, the hinderance is that some companies may be slow to adapt to the changing world and think the infrastructure they currently have in place is just fine. Also, there is not enough data when talking about social media marketing, to maybe convince upper management that taking that route could make their business more profitable. Sure, it may get more page views and raise more awareness of products, but can you say for sure that it translated directly into sales?
          </p>
           <br>
           <p>
            So there in lies the issue with driving growth and profits for a business.How does the IT industry play a role in finding or being the solution? I think a few solutions to this challenge include: time, more data, and better planning for gradual change. Time is probably the most important, as CEO's and directors need time to see that switching to newer technology and new ways to do business is really paying off in terms of speed at which business is done, efficiency and profits.
            More Data or more research is also needed because right now as new technology is coming out with new apps and software that claims to make your business more efficient, not enough data is there to prove that it actually does.  Finally, better planning may be the ultimate solution as many times from personal experience, we see the latest and greatest thing out there and jump into it without slowing integrating it. I think not only IT directors, but the IT industry in general could do a better job planning and deploying strategies on how to ease the general public into newer technology because when a new technology is dumped on older mindsets there is a lot of hesitation towards it. If better strategies were put into place maybe thru marketing campaigns and product testing on more user groups, it may end up in the long run, making everyone more profitable as older mindsets would feel more at ease and companies will have more time and more comfort with gradually implementing new technology as the old infrastructures begin to fade out.
           </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Those are some of my thoughts on some of the issues facing the tech industry today. I think with better planning, time, and money, all industries can benefit, because the IT industry touches every single one.
            </p>

            Thanks,
            <br>
