              HI!
            </p>
            <p>
              This is my very first blog post so I wanted to kick things off by introducing myself and a little about this blog.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am originally from Louisiana (side note: we don't all dress/act/talk like the people you see on "Swamp People") where I've spent the past 7 years in an IT support position.After working as a support technician for numerous years, I wanted to venture out a little and begin learning how to code.  I didnt know where to begin or what to create, all I knew was that I wanted to learn how to create something using a programming language!  I've always had the desire to learn but for fear of failure was afraid to step out and begin the process.
            </p>
            <p> Anyways, fast forward to early February 2015, where I got accepted to embark on this amazing journey called: Dev Bootcamp.  Dev Bootcamp is a 19 week coding bootcamp aimed at transforming new programmers into jr web developers or as we like to call it: "World Class Beginners".
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that I've finshed the program, I am currently searching for a role as a Jr. Developer while learning new technology everyday! I'm excited about coding and wanted to start blogging about the new things I'm learning.. hopefully in a way that any newbie who is in the same position I was in, can understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hope you Enjoy the blog! and feel free to contact me with any questions or comments via twitter! (<a href="https://twitter.com/n8leeDBC">@n8leedbc</a>)
