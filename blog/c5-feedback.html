        <h2>Pairing & Feedback at DBC.</h2>
        <h3>Is it Actionable, Specific, & Kind?</h3>
        <h4>3/22/15</h4>
          <p>

          This week we were asked to write about Pairing and Giving feedback so I am going to talk a little about my experiences so far. Pairing is something totally new to me so I was a little nervous when I first started pairing with my other cohorts. The more I paired, the more comfortable I became in collaborating with complete strangers on coding challenges.
          <br>
          The best part about pairing for a coding challenge is that you have another person there to throw around ideas with and to lean on when you are not understanding something.  It's a great benefit because a lot of times someone will be more knowledgeable than you in a certain area of coding or they may have more experience in general, which is the perfect time to sit back, keep your mouth shut and just learn.
          <br>
          On the flip side, there are times when the other person can be a bit controlling or is just totally focused on their ideas and thoughts and are not considering yours. That makes the pairing a little challenging and frustrating, but in the end you learn from it and know what not to do or how not to treat people when you pair again.
          <br>
          When I read my feedback, for the most part it made me feel like I was treating people with respect and doing something right. I got a lot of positive feedback that helped me notice what I need to continue doing. But there are some things I can improve on such as becoming more technically sound and being more prepared in the readings before I pair, and reaching out for help through tutoring or people in my acconuntability group.
          <br>
          The most difficult thing about giving feedback is giving constructive criticism. For the most part everyone is a great person to pair with. But when they are not, I feel like its hard for me to articulate that in a way that's kind and actionable. But I think the main thing to focus on when writing feedback is to focus on how the other person made you feel when they did this or that..
          <br>
          Overall, I think using pairing and feedback is helping to guide my learning because I've found that I'm able to help others, and find people who are struggling just like me, and at the same time learn a great deal from those that have a lot more knowledge then myself.
